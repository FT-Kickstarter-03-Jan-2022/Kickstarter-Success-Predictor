# Kickstarter Success Predictor 

Ever wanted to know if your big idea for a kickstart project would be a success? Well, this is an app that was built to predict whether a Kickstarter campaign will be a success or failure and also gives the user help to optimize their campaign for a higher chance of success. It takes in user input and returns a prediction using a machine learning algorithm based on the given values for the date created, the date launched, the number of backers, goal amount, USD pledged, month launched, category, country code, and currency code.

## How to use
Visit the link to our [app](https://kickstartesuccessds34.herokuapp.com/) here you can give the required information about your Kickstarter project. Click check odds and it will return a prediction based on our machine learning model of whether the campaign will be a success or failure.   
Based on our machine learning model we recommend getting your campaign as a "staff pick" and focusing on a good goal as these are the 2 most important features to consider when predicting whether a campaign will be successful or not.
